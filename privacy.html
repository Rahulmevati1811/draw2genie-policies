    <h1>Privacy Policy for Draw2Genie</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 4, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Little Trisha Studio ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our mobile application, Draw2Genie (the "App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided Drawings:</strong> When you use the App, you create drawings on the canvas. We collect this drawing data when you initiate the image generation process. This data is necessary for the core functionality of the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Generated Images & Metadata:</strong> We temporarily process the images generated by the AI based on your drawings and associated metadata (like descriptions or tags generated by the AI).</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Information:</strong> We partner with Google AdMob to serve advertisements within the App (specifically, rewarded video ads). AdMob may collect device identifiers (like the Advertising ID), IP address, device information, and information about your interaction with ads to provide personalized or non-personalized advertising and for measurement purposes. Please refer to Google's Advertising Privacy & Terms: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide Core App Functionality:</strong> To process your drawings, send relevant data to the AI generation service (Google Gemini API), receive the generated image, and display it to you within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>To Serve Advertisements:</strong> To display rewarded video ads via Google AdMob, allowing you to earn additional image generations.</li>
        <li><strong>To Comply with Law:</strong> To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We may share your information as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Backend Hosting:</strong> Your drawing data is sent to our backend server hosted on Render (or our chosen provider) for processing before being sent to the AI API.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Generation Service (Google):</strong> We send your drawing data (or prompts derived from it) to Google's Generative Language API (Gemini) to generate the images. Google's use of this data is subject to their own privacy policies and terms. See Google's AI policies for details.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>With Advertising Partners (Google AdMob):</strong> As described in Section 1, information is shared with Google AdMob for advertising purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) enforce our Terms of Service, (b) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues, or (c) protect the rights, property, or safety of ourselves, our users, or the public.</li>
        <li><strong>In Case of Business Transfer:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable measures to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the App, our backend, and the Google Gemini API. However, please be aware that no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We aim to minimize data retention. User drawing data sent to our backend is processed to generate the image and is not stored long-term on our servers after the generation process is complete. Data associated with AdMob is retained according to Google's policies.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information promptly. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising Choices:</strong> You may be able to limit ad tracking using the settings provided by your device operating system (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android).</li>
        <li><strong>Accessing or Deleting Information:</strong> If you wish to inquire about or request deletion of any drawing data potentially associated with your usage, please contact us at rmevati10@gmail.com. We will respond to requests as required by applicable law. Note that due to the nature of the service (no user accounts), identifying specific user data may be limited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of the policy and potentially providing additional notice (such as through the App). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
